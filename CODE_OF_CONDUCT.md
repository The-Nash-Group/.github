# The Immortal's Code - Code of Conduct

> *"Honor is the only currency that matters in The Game."*

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of The Nash Group, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Like Immortals who have walked through centuries learning from every culture and civilization, we pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## The Rules of The Game

### 1. The First Rule: Respect

*"We are all Immortals here, each with our own story spanning centuries."*

- **Show Empathy**: Every contributor brings unique perspectives
- **Be Patient**: Not everyone learns at the same pace
- **Listen First**: Seek to understand before being understood
- **Assume Good Intent**: Start from a place of trust

### 2. The Second Rule: Honor

*"A warrior's honor is their most valuable possession."*

- **Keep Your Word**: If you commit to something, follow through
- **Give Credit**: Acknowledge the contributions of others
- **Admit Mistakes**: Even Immortals can err; own your errors
- **Help Others**: Share your knowledge freely

### 3. The Third Rule: Excellence

*"We build for the ages, not for the moment."*

- **Pursue Mastery**: Continuously improve your craft
- **Quality Over Speed**: Better to do it right than do it twice
- **Document Everything**: Future Immortals will thank you
- **Test Thoroughly**: Every blade must be tested before battle

## Holy Ground - Safe Spaces

The following are considered Holy Ground where no conflicts may occur:

- **New Contributor Issues**: Be extra welcoming and helpful
- **Learning Discussions**: No question is too basic
- **Mental Health Topics**: Support without judgment
- **Personal Struggles**: Compassion always

## Unacceptable Behavior - The Forbidden Acts

The following behaviors will result in immediate intervention:

### The Cardinal Sins

- **Harassment**: Including offensive comments, personal attacks, or unwelcome attention
- **Discrimination**: Based on any protected characteristic
- **Doxxing**: Publishing private information without consent
- **Trolling**: Deliberately inflammatory or disruptive behavior
- **Spam**: Repeated off-topic or promotional content

### The Minor Transgressions

- **Unconstructive Criticism**: Criticism without suggested improvements
- **Gatekeeping**: "Real developers don't..." attitudes
- **Bike-shedding**: Excessive debate over trivial matters
- **Abandonment**: Leaving PRs or issues without communication

## The Quickening - Enforcement

### Reporting

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior:

1. **Direct Message**: Contact a moderator directly
2. **Email**: conduct@thenashgroup.dev
3. **Anonymous Form**: https://thenashgroup.dev/report

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### The Judgment Process

1. **Warning**: First offense typically results in a private warning
2. **Temporary Ban**: Repeated or severe violations result in temporary exclusion
3. **Permanent Ban**: Egregious violations or repeated offenses after warnings

### The Appeals Process

Those who feel they have been unfairly judged may appeal:
- Email: appeals@thenashgroup.dev
- Include: Full context, your perspective, and desired outcome

## Responsibilities of Mentors

Mentors (project maintainers) are responsible for:

- **Setting Standards**: Clarifying and enforcing our standards
- **Taking Action**: Appropriate corrective action for violations
- **Creating Safety**: Ensuring all feel welcome and safe
- **Leading by Example**: Modeling the behavior we expect

Mentors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
- Comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for violations

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Community forums and chat rooms
- Community events (virtual and in-person)
- Official social media accounts
- Private communications representing the community

## The Wisdom of Ages

### Remember:

- **"We're all students"**: Everyone is learning something
- **"Strength through diversity"**: Our differences make us stronger
- **"Legacy matters"**: Your actions today echo through time
- **"Grace in victory and defeat"**: How you handle both defines you

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, and inspired by the timeless principles that govern The Game.
