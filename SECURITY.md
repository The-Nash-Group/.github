# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy - Holy Ground Protocols

> *"Holy Ground is sanctuary. No Immortal may fight on Holy Ground."*

The Nash Group takes security as seriously as an Immortal guards their head. This document outlines our security policies and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities.

## üèõÔ∏è Our Security Philosophy

Like the sacred rules that govern Immortals, our security principles are inviolate:

1. **Zero Trust** - Trust no one, verify everything
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of protection, like chainmail beneath armor
3. **Least Privilege** - Grant only the power absolutely necessary
4. **Immutable Audit** - Every action is chronicled, every event recorded
5. **Rapid Response** - Swift as a blade when threats emerge

## üîê Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Service | Version | Support Status | End of Life |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| The Gathering | 2.x.x | ‚úÖ Active | - |
| The Gathering | 1.x.x | ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Only | 2025-06-01 |
| The Prize | 1.x.x | ‚úÖ Active | - |
| The Watcher | 3.x.x | ‚úÖ Active | - |
| The Watcher | 2.x.x | ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Only | 2025-03-01 |
| The Sword CLI | 1.x.x | ‚úÖ Active | - |

Versions not listed above are considered end-of-life and will not receive security updates.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### The Sacred Protocol

If you discover a security vulnerability within The Nash Group's realm, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Secure Communication Channel

Report security vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Navigate to the affected repository
   - Click "Security" ‚Üí "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the security advisory form

2. **Encrypted Email**
   - Email: security@thenashgroup.dev
   - PGP Key: [Download our PGP key](https://thenashgroup.dev/pgp-key.asc)
   - Key Fingerprint: `XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX`

### What to Include

Your report should contain:

```markdown
## Vulnerability Report

**Attack Vector:** [Network/Local/Physical]

### Description
[Clear description of the vulnerability]

## ‚ö° Response Timeline - The Quickening Protocol

Our incident response follows The Quickening Protocol:

| Time | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| 0-24 hours | Acknowledge receipt of vulnerability report |
| 24-72 hours | Initial assessment and severity classification |
| 72 hours - 7 days | Develop and test fix for critical/high severity |
| 7-14 days | Develop and test fix for medium severity |
| 14-30 days | Develop and test fix for low severity |
| After fix | Coordinated disclosure with reporter |

### Severity Classifications

- **üíÄ Critical**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data breach
- **üó°Ô∏è High**: Privilege escalation, significant data exposure
- **‚öîÔ∏è Medium**: Limited data exposure, denial of service
- **üõ°Ô∏è Low**: Information disclosure, non-exploitable issues

## üèÜ Recognition - The Immortal's Honor

We believe in recognizing those who help us maintain Holy Ground:

### Hall of Guardians

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Added to our Hall of Guardians (with permission)
- Acknowledged in security advisories
- Eligible for Nash Group swag

### Bug Bounty Program

While we don't currently offer monetary rewards, we're evaluating a bug bounty program. Check back for updates.
