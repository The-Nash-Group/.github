# The Nash Group - Code Ownership Registry
# ==========================================
#
# This document declares the Immortals responsible for different realms
# of The Nash Group's codebase. Like territories claimed through centuries
# of conquest, each path has its guardian.
#
# The Mentors review all changes, but specific domains require blessing
# from their appointed guardians.
